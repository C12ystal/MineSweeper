|----------------------------------Minesweeper-----------------------------------|  

Basically the mine sweeper we all know and love with some slight changes  

    The color scheme is different   
    There are 3 regular difficulties and 2 secret unfair ones  
    
|------------------------------Mechanics-and-Rules-------------------------------|  

1 to 1 of the mechanics of minesweeper  

    The field generates dependant on your difficulty setting
    Size and the amount of mines change depending on your difficulty
    You can dig cells on the map by left clicking on them
    If you hit a mine, you are out
    The first cell you dig is never a mine, the game gives you atleast a 5x5 space
        of a safe zone the first click
    The field has numbers that show how many mines they have adjecent to them
    You can put flags on any cells that you think has a mine under 
        to stop you from accidentally clicking and hitting a mine
    If there are the same amount of flags adjecent to a number as the number itself
        you can click on it to reveal the adjecent cells that don't have a flag on them
    The game ends if you manage to dig all the cells that don't contain a mine
